##  Cybersecurity Context

Spam and phishing emails are one of the most common cyber attack vectors.  
This model demonstrates:
- How NLP can detect phishing patterns  
- How machine learning transforms security workflows  
- Why automated filtering is essential in SOC operations  

Transforming email text into TF-IDF vectors allows the system to learn patterns such as:
- Urgency (“URGENT IMMEDIATELY”)  
- Rewards (“Congratulations! You won…”)  
- Malicious links (“Click to claim…”)

## 📌 Conclusion

This task demonstrates a functional and understandable approach to building a spam detection model using basic machine learning techniques. While simple, the workflow reflects real cybersecurity applications and lays a foundation for more advanced systems like Transformers and deep learning spam detectors.
