##  Overview
This project is part of Task 3 of the final exam.
The goal is to create and train a machine learning model that can classify emails as spam or ham (not spam).
The project demonstrates how machine learning is used in cybersecurity to detect phishing and malicious emails.

##  How the Model Works

### 1. Dataset
The dataset contains short example emails labeled as spam or ham.
The dataset is saved as sample_dataset.csv and is also generated by the Python script.

### 2. Text Preprocessing
TF-IDF vectorization transforms text into numerical features.

### 3. Machine Learning Algorithm
Logistic Regression is used because it is simple, fast, and effective for text classification.

### 4. Train/Test Split
80% training data, 20% testing data.

### 5. Evaluation
The script prints:
- Accuracy
- Precision, recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix
And shows a confusion matrix heatmap.

##  How to Run the Project

### 1. Install required libraries
pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib

### 2. Run the classifier
python spam_classifier.py

### 3. Output
Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and visualization.

##  Cybersecurity Context
Spam and phishing emails are used for:
- credential theft
- malware delivery
- scams
- social engineering
Machine learning helps detect suspicious wording, fake urgency, and malicious intent.

##  Conclusion
This project demonstrates how ML can classify emails for cybersecurity.
It covers dataset creation, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization.
